# ADR-001: Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Communication

**Date:** 2026-03-13
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The A2 architecture requires two services to collaborate: a sensor service that stores sensor readings, and an alert service that evaluates those readings against threshold rules. Two interaction patterns were available:

- **Synchronous (REST):** The alert service periodically polls or the sensor service calls the alert service inline during a sensor update.
- **Asynchronous (message queue):** The sensor service emits an event after each update; the alert service consumes it independently.

A third use case also emerged: when creating an alert rule, the alert service must verify that the referenced sensor actually exists. This is inherently synchronous — it is a validation check that must succeed or fail before the rule is persisted.

## Decision

Use **both** patterns, each where it fits best:

- **Asynchronous (RabbitMQ fanout)** for sensor update → alert evaluation. When a sensor's value changes, the sensor service publishes a `sensor.updated` event. The alert service consumes it and evaluates rules.
- **Synchronous (HTTP with circuit breaker)** for sensor existence validation at rule creation time.

## Rationale

### Why async for sensor update → alert evaluation

Sensor updates may occur at high frequency. Evaluating alerts synchronously inside the `PUT /sensors/:id` handler would add latency to every update and create tight coupling — the sensor service would need to know the alert service's address, and a slow or unavailable alert service would block sensor writes.

Using a fanout exchange means:
- The sensor service remains unaware of consumers; new services can subscribe without any code changes.
- Sensor write latency is unaffected by alert evaluation time.
- If the alert service is temporarily unavailable, RabbitMQ queues the events and they are processed upon recovery.
- Multiple alert services (Python and Go) can consume the same events independently.

### Why sync for sensor validation

Rule creation is a user-initiated action (not high-frequency). Validating that the sensor exists before persisting a rule provides an immediate, clear error response. This is qualitatively different from fire-and-forget event processing. The circuit breaker fallback preserves availability even when the sensor service is down — the rule is created with a warning rather than being rejected.

## Consequences

- Sensor updates gain resilience and decoupling at the cost of eventual consistency — alerts may be evaluated milliseconds after the sensor value is written. Thus, if a sensor value crosses a threshold and then returns back to the side of the threshold that doesn't trigger the alert before the consumer processes the event, the alert fires on a value that is no longer current, and that is an accepted risk of the eventual consistency expressed here.
- Alert rule creation requires the sensor service to be reachable (or tolerates its unavailability via circuit breaker fallback).
- RabbitMQ becomes a required infrastructure component, meaning both local dev and CI require a running broker, increasing setup friction.
- RabbitMQ's fanout delivers messages in order per consumer, but in the case of multiple consumer instances, if one update is received by one consumer instance shortly before another one is received by another consumer instance but the first consumer processes the former update slightly more slowly than the second consumer processes the latter update, the slightly newer alert might be evaluated first.
- In reactive pipeline mode (`PIPELINE_MODE=async`), events are emitted into a reactive stream (RxPY `Subject` in Python, RxGo `Observable` in Go). The stream's `flat_map` operator limits concurrent evaluations to `WORKER_COUNT` — this is the reactive backpressure mechanism. The consumer acks a message before the reactive pipeline finishes evaluating it, which improves throughput but means that if the process crashes between ack and evaluation, the event is silently dropped. In blocking mode, the ack happens after evaluation completes, so a crash causes the broker to redeliver — a stronger at-least-once guarantee at the cost of lower throughput.
